# atrip_resources
Input files to verify the disk reader

Usage: adapt run.sh and execute

Studied system is taken from: \
https://github.com/cc4s/test-resources/tree/master/hf \
which is used here \
https://github.com/cc4s/cc4s/tree/master/test/tests/hf

The data is generated by a (yet) not public cc4s version. 

Note:
As the input file (cc4s.in) shows the tensors are stored
either in row major or column major format.
!! The correct format is mandatory for a valid run !!
